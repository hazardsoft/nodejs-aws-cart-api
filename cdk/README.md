# Overview

Contains AWS CDK infrastructure as code for Cart Service.
Describes the following resources:

1. Lambda cart handler (uses basic auth token encoded in Base64 provided in `Authorization` request header to authenticate an user);
2. RDS DB instance (Postgres) to store users, cart items, carts, orders;
3. Network resources (e.g. VPC and security groups) to provide means of communication between Lambda and RDS DB instance, RDS DB instance and Internet

## Environment

### RDS DB Instance

The following env vars are used by AWS CDK stack during RDS DB instance creation (copy/paste [.env.example](./.env.example), rename it to `.env` and fill with the relevant values):

- `DATABASE_USERNAME`;
- `DATABASE_PASSWORD`.

### Lambda - Cart Handler

The following env var is passed into cart handler in order to provide access to previously created RDS DB instance:

- `DATABASE_URL` - generated dynamically based on db instance endpoint host/port values + username/password passed via `.env` file.

## NPM scripts

- `lint` - runs ESLint with fix option

- `format` - runs Prettier with fix option

- `build` - builds Lambdas and AWS CDK application

- `test` - runs unit tests for AWS CDK application
- `cdk` - builds/runs AWS CDK project (no need to call manually, it's used in `cdk.json` config file);

- `cdk:diff` - runs AWS CDK diff command to illustrate how local template is different to a deployed one (in order to use a user's profile the script needs to be run as `npm run cdk:diff -- --profile={profile_name}`)

- `cdk:deploy` - runs AWS CDK deploy command to deploy stack (in order to use a user's profile the script needs to be run as `npm run cdk:deploy -- --profile={profile_name}`)

- `cdk:destroy` - runs AWS CDK destroy command to destroy previously deployed stack (in order to use a user's profile the script needs to be run as `npm run cdk:destroy -- --profile={profile_name}`)

## Deployment

In order to deploy application stack with AWS CDK one needs to run the following command:
`npm run cdk:deploy` (in order to use a user's profile the script needs to be run as `npm run cdk:deploy -- --profile={profile_name}`)
